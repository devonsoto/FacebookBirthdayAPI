Using Facebook's API the script downloads the user's name and id.
It checks the User's wall and replies to any post that are relating to wishing him a happy birthday.

I have been able to download any my wall posts, check to see if the post is made on my birthday, and to see if it is related to my birthday.

The steps that I need to complete the project is to just post a Thank you comment to the user.
