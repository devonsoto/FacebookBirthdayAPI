**NOTE:** The script does not work because Facebook combines all birthday post to one object and thus we cannot comment to individual post. See attached file for an example.

**FacebookReplies.py:** Using Facebook's API, this script downloads the post on their wall. It then checks to see if the post has a message. If the message contains a key words then it will reply to the user. 

- [x] Download and collect user's wall 
- [x] Check to see if it is a valid post/message
- [x] Reply to the poster with a message of my choice
